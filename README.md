# Vigenere-Solver
A Vigenere Cipher Decoder. Uses IOC (Index of Coincidence) to approximate the key length, N, which is used to divide the ciphertext into N chunks. It then uses frequency analysis to determine the letter that decrypts each chunk, combining them all to form the plaintext.
# Instructions On How to Run
